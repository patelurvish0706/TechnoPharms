### *5. feature*
### - It allows multiple Shoopkeepers to register. also more than single shops shown in nearbyshop page if there are any in that 10km radius.✨🏪

aside from this. i also created User login and register, but as logical and real world scenario. Any troubled user focus on finding possible solution for thier techs and avoid unusual logins and registations. so adding that feature is on hold.
